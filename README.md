Project Overview:
The Car Sales Analysis project focuses on visualizing and analyzing sales trends, customer demographics, and company performance using Power BI. The dataset includes details of car purchases, such as customer information, car specifications, and pricing. The goal is to provide insights that help dealerships understand sales patterns, customer preferences, and pricing strategies.

Dataset Details: The dataset consists of the following fields:

Car ID: A unique identifier for each car sold.

Date: The date of the car purchase.

Customer Name: The name of the customer who purchased the car.

Annual Income: The annual income of the customer, useful for analyzing customer affordability and targeting demographics.

Company: The manufacturer or brand of the car (e.g., Toyota, Ford, Honda).

Model: The specific model of the car (e.g., Corolla, Mustang, Civic).

Engine: Details about the car engine (e.g., engine size, type, horsepower).

Price: The sale price of the car


Key Insights:

1. Sales Trends: Analyze the number of cars sold over time (monthly/quarterly/yearly), identifying peak sales periods and any seasonality trends.


2. Customer Demographics: Analyze customer income distribution to understand which income brackets are purchasing specific car models or brands.


3. Top Models and Brands: Identify the best-selling car models and companies over the given time period, highlighting customer preferences.


4. Pricing Analysis: Explore price distribution across different models, engine types, and brands. Understand the pricing strategy by examining the correlation between car prices and customer income.


5. Revenue and Sales Growth: Measure total revenue generated from car sales and track growth trends across different time periods.


6. Engine Type Preferences: Analyze which engine types (e.g., fuel efficiency or performance engines) are most popular across different customer groups.


Power BI Features Used:

Bar Charts & Line Charts: To display sales trends over time and compare brand/model performances.

Pie Charts: To showcase customer income distribution and car model preferences.

Slicers: To filter the data by specific brands, models, or customer income groups for in-depth analysis.
